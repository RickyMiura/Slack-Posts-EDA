# Overview

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large dataset of Slack posts using **Apache Spark** and **AWS**. The primary objective was to handle and analyze the big dataset efficiently, uncovering trends, patterns, and insights from Slack messages at scale.

## Key Highlights:
- **Big Data Processing**: Leveraged Spark for distributed data processing, enabling efficient handling of large Slack datasets.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilized AWS services for data storage, processing, and scaling the analysis infrastructure.
- **Insights and Trends**: Explored key metrics such as message frequency, user activity patterns, and common topics across Slack posts.

This project demonstrates the power of combining **big data tools** like Spark with **cloud computing** to analyze large datasets and generate actionable insights.
